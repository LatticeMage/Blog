# Flow is Wild Instinct

**Introduction**

Ever wondered why we are so captivated by the concept of being "in the flow"? The flow state is all about living in the present moment, completely immersed in what weâ€™re doing. Interestingly, this state seems to align closely with our natural instincts.

**Animals and Flow**

Think about animals like cats and dogs. They live in the here and now, without the burden of past regrets or future worries. In many ways, they are always in a flow state. This makes you question whether the stories we hear from pet communicators about animal memories are more fantasy than reality.

**Children and Societal Influence**

Young children naturally enter flow states with ease, before societal norms and pressures start to shape them. As we grow older, these pressures often cause us to lose touch with this innate ability. This loss might be why we continuously seek out the flow state as adults.

**Biological Instincts and Flow**

Hereâ€™s a thought: Could achieving flow simply be about reconnecting with our biological instincts? Research shows that being in flow releases pleasurable brain chemicals, suggesting that seeking flow might be a way of satisfying our natural biological needs.

**Conclusion**

In essence, embracing flow could be about tapping into our wild instincts more than we realize. ðŸŒŸðŸ’­
