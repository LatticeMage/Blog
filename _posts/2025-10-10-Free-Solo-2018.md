# What Happens After Watching *Free Solo* (2018): Falling Into the World of Fearless Climbers and Parkour Masters

When I first watched the 2018 documentary *Free Solo*, I felt my palms sweat just sitting on the couch. Watching **Alex Honnold** ascend *El Capitan* without a rope was both terrifying and hypnotic. It wasn’t just a film — it was a glimpse into the mind of someone who sees the world vertically, not horizontally.  

But after the credits rolled, curiosity hit me hard:  
**Who else lives this kind of fearless life?**  
And could there be people who blend this art of climbing with the flow of **parkour**?

## 🧗‍♂️ The Titans of Free Solo Climbing

The world of free soloing is small, dangerous, and incredibly inspiring. After Alex Honnold’s iconic climb, I discovered others who’ve pushed their own boundaries in silence and stone:

- **Alain Robert**, the “French Spider-Man,” climbs skyscrapers barehanded — no ropes, no harness, often barefoot, turning city walls into cliffs.  
- **Hansjörg Auer**, who soloed *The Fish Route* in the Dolomites — a 750m wall of pure commitment.  
- **Dean Potter** and **Peter Croft**, Yosemite legends who treated cliffs as canvases for meditation and courage.  
- **Catherine Destivelle**, the French pioneer who free soloed the *Eiger North Face*, proving grace can exist alongside danger.

Each of them shows that free soloing isn’t just about risk; it’s about *clarity*. A quiet, almost spiritual focus where fear becomes fuel.

## 🤸‍♂️ Then Came the Connection — Parkour and Free Solo

While climbing is about *vertical stillness*, **parkour** is about *horizontal flow*. One is meditative; the other, explosive. But both demand the same core truth — **total mastery of body and mind**.

This led me to a fascinating question:  
> Are there athletes who bridge these two worlds?

Surprisingly, yes.

- **Léo Urban** is one of the clearest examples — a parkour athlete who’s also a real free solo climber. He’s climbed skyscrapers like the 210m **Tour Montparnasse** in Paris, blending parkour agility with free solo precision.  
- His partner **Alexis Landot** combines parkour and urban free soloing, turning cities into vertical playgrounds.  
- Others, like the **STORROR** collective or **Tim Shieff**, bring freerunning’s grace into buildering and deep-water soloing — not true mountain free soloing, but still rope-less mastery.

These athletes are redefining movement. They show how the line between climbing and parkour is thinner than we think — both are languages of freedom.

## 💭 What Watching *Free Solo* Really Does

After falling down this rabbit hole of research, one thing became clear:  
*Free Solo* isn’t just a movie about climbing — it’s about how far we can push human potential when fear and focus meet perfectly.  

Whether it’s Honnold on El Capitan, Urban scaling glass towers, or parkour athletes flying over rooftops — they all share the same spirit:  
A calm heart.  
A powerful body.  
And a complete trust in themselves.

## 🌍 Final Thought

After *Free Solo*, I realized it’s not about copying these athletes — it’s about **understanding the mindset** behind their courage.  
You might never hang from a granite wall or leap across rooftops, but the next time you face fear — physical or emotional — remember:  
> Mastery isn’t about killing fear.  
> It’s about moving with it.
