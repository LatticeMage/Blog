While I appreciate using Airtable and Monday for project management, they are not ideal for team management.

Firstly, Monday requires a paid subscription for team groups. Secondly, many features in Airtable are locked for free users, and it can be too complex for the average user.

In contrast, GitHub Project Task Management is the best free tool for team collaboration. It offers enough features without being overly complicated.

Currently, I use GitHub Projects for most of my collaborative efforts.
